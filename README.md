# fool

A powerful git commandline interface which is focused on usability. Use quick keyboard shortcuts to manage your repository, files and commits.


## How to use

`fool` is centered around keyboard shortcuts. Use the arrow-keys to move your cursor, then press a key to issue an action to the selected file. Some commands (committing, pushing, managing remotes, etc) will trigger the same action, no matter the selected file.
